RubyGems 3.4.0 includes nice improvements such as:

* It will unobstrusively inform you when it's out of date.
* It will cleanup intermediate files after building and installing extensions, saving disk space.

It also drops support for Ruby 2.3, Ruby 2.4 and Ruby 2.5. Time to move on!

To update to the latest RubyGems you can run:

    gem update --system
