RubyGems 3.2.3 fixes a long standing bug in the gem client.

`gem install` now doesn't try to forcefully install the latest version of the
target gem if the current ruby or rubygems version doesn't meet its
`required_ruby_version` or `required_rubygems_version` requirements,
respectively. Instead, it will try to install the newest version that supports
those.

As a result, running `gem install rails` on ruby 2.4 now installs rails 5.2.4.4,
the latest rails that supports ruby 2.4, instead of raising an error.

You may have needed to update your workflows running old rubies with something
like the following to workaround this issue:

    gem install bundler -v '~> 1.17'

Indeed, when we dropped support for old rubies in bundler and released bundler 2,
that meant `gem install bundler` suddenly started failing for people still
running those rubies.

If you update rubygems in those workflows using

    gem update --system

You can go back to the previous `gem install bundler` and rubygems will do the
right thing.

If you need to upgrade or downgrade please follow the [how to upgrade/downgrade
RubyGems][upgrading] instructions.  To install RubyGems by hand see the
[Download RubyGems][download] page.
