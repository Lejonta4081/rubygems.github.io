Do you know how you used to dread getting the following message while
installing gems?

  Updating Gem source index for: http://gems.rubyforge.org

It could take up to 30 seconds (on my machine, even worse on others) for
that crazy source index to update.

This latest release of RubyGems speeds that wait time up considerably.
The following table gives the following times for installing RedCloth
with a required source index update on three system we had available to
us.  No RDoc generation was included in the following times.

  RubyGems    Linux         Mac OSX      Windows
  0.8.4       33 secs       73 secs      58 secs
  0.8.5        8 secs       14 secs      21 secs

The new caching code is at least 3x faster than previous versions.  Woo
Hoo!
