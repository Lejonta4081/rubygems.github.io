Welcome to the RubyGems monthly update! As part of our efforts at Ruby Central, we publish a recap of the work that weâ€™ve done the previous month. Read on to find out what updates were made to RubyGems and RubyGems.org in September.

## RubyGems News

This month in RubyGems, we released RubyGems [v3.3.22](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#3322--2022-09-07) and Bundler [v2.3.22](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/bundler/CHANGELOG.md#2322-september-7-2022).

We also shipped the following improvements and fixes (see the changelog for more):

- added `bundle-console` command in Bundler's documentation - [#5901](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5901). 
- updated the Bundler metadata source code URI for accuracy in gemspec - [#5896](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5896).
- removed warning for old TLS version connections - [#5928](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5928).
- removed no longer needed `fiddle` hacks since RubyInstaller released patch versions to not load `fiddle` on boot - [#5902](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5902).

In addition to the above, this month we've been working on migrating Bundler's internal resolver engine to use Pub Grub, which should result in a much better error messages and resolution performance. We hope to release this work soon. 

Also, we have removed the feature of auto-sudo'ing when not having enough permissions to perform certain operations, because it was considered harmful and hardly useful. This removal will be released with Bundler 2.4.

In September, RubyGems gained [94 new commits](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/compare/master@%7B2022-09-01%7D...master@%7B2022-09-31%7D), contributed by 19 authors. There were 1,678 additions and 1,869 deletions across 161 files.
