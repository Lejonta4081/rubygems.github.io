You can now link to your [Gittip](https://www.gittip.com) account from your
RubyGems profile page.

Gittip is a way to give small weekly cash gifts to people you love and are
inspired by.  You can find more details on the [Gittip about
page](https://www.gittip.com/about/).  If you don't have a Gittip account you
can quickly create one by clicking the sign-in button in the top-right corner
and logging in through Twitter, Github or Bitbucket.  You can also [create a
Gittip account for an organization](https://www.gittip.com/about/terms/).

After you've signed in, you can [edit your RubyGems
profile](https://rubygems.org/profile/edit) to include your Gittip username.

PS:  Here is the [RubyGems.org team account](https://www.gittip.com/rubygems/)
