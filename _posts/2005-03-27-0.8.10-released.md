* In multi-user environments, it is common to supply mulitple versions of gems
  (for example Rails), allowing individual users to select the version of the
  gem they desire.  This allows a user to be insulated from updates to that
  gem.  RubyGems 0.8.10 fixes a problem where gems could occasionally become
  confused about the current versions of libraries selected by the user.
* The other annoying bug is that if there are any existing rubygems-update gems
  installed, then the "gem update --system" command will download a new
  update, but install the latest update prior to the download.
