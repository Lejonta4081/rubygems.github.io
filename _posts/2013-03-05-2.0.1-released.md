_NOTE:_ This release has been yanked due to a bug in HTTPS handling that may
leave you unable to install gems or upgrade RubyGems.  [2.0.2][bugfixfix] has
been released to address these issues.

RubyGems 2.0.1 is a bug-fix release.  To update to the latest RubyGems you can
run:

    gem update --system

To install RubyGems by hand see the [Download RubyGems][download] page.  To
downgrade RubyGems see [how to upgrade/downgrade RubyGems][upgrading].

* HTTPS URLs are preferred over HTTP URLs.  RubyGems will now attempt to upgrade any HTTP source to HTTPS.  Credit to Alex Gaynor.
