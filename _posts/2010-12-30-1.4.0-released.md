NOTE: In order to better maintain rubygems and to get it in sync with
the world (eg, 1.9's 1.3.7 is different from our 1.3.7), rubygems is
switching to a 4-6 week release schedule. This release is the
precursor to that process and as such may be a bit on the wild side!
You have been warned!

NOTE: We've switched to git/github. See README.rdoc for details.

New features:

* Added --launch option to `gem server`. (gthiesfeld)
* Added fuzzy name matching on install failures. (gstark/presidentbeef)
* Allow searching w/ file extensions: gem which fileutils.rb
* Progress indicator during download (Ryan Melton)
* Speed up Gem::Version#<=> by 2-3x in common cases. (raggi)
* --source is now additive with your current sources.
  Use --clear-sources first to maintain previous behavior.

Bug fixes:

* Dependency "~>"s now respect lower-bound prerelease versions.
* Ensure the gem directories exist on download.
* Expand Windows user home candidates for Ruby 1.8. Bug #28371 & #28494
* Fix find_files to order by version.
* Fix ivar typo. \[Josh Peek\]
* Normalized requires and made many of them lazy.
  Do not depend on rubygems to require stdlib stuff for you. (raggi/tmm1)
* Treat 1.0.a10 like 1.0.a.10 for sorting, etc. Fixes #27903. (dchelimsky)
