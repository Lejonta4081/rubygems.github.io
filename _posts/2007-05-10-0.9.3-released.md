Bug Fixes Include:

The ZLib library on Windows will occasionally complains about a buffer error
when unpacking gems.  The Gems software has a workaround for that problem, but
the workaround was only enabled for versions of ZLib 1.2.1 or earlier.  We
have received several reports of the error occuring with ZLib 1.2.3, so we
have permanently enabled the work around on all versions.
