Welcome to the RubyGems monthly update! As part of our efforts at Ruby Central, we publish a recap of the work that we’ve done the previous month. Read on to find out what updates were made to RubyGems and RubyGems.org in November.

## RubyGems News

This month in RubyGems, we released RubyGems [3.4.22](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#3422--2023-11-09) and Bundler [2.4.22](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/bundler/CHANGELOG.md#2422-november-9-2023). These updates mark significant milestones in our continuous effort to enhance the Ruby development experience.

One of the key changes is a boost in performance, achieved by eliminating the need for regular expression matches in `Gem::Platform.local` ([#7104](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/7104)). Additionally, we shipped an update of the SPDX license list, ensuring that RubyGems is in line with the most recent industry standards ([#7040](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/7040)).

Another important update: The YAML serializer has been enhanced to correctly handle empty arrays ([#7099](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/7099)). The search process has also been refined, now effectively ignoring `.gem `files that are not in tar format ([#7095](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/7095)). The update also brings a new feature that allows users to uninstall multiple versions of the same gem at once, making gem management more efficient ([#7063](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/7063)).

Some other improvements that landed into our repo this month that are NOT included in the above releases are:

- an added response body on `fetch_http error` ([#7148](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/7148)).
- a more robust writability check for gem home ([#7211](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/7211)).
- an update to the Magnus library in the Rust extension gem template ([#7204](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/7204)).
- an update to gem uninstall error reporting ([#7149](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/7149)).
- an added `--json` output option to bundle-outdated ([#7167](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/7167)).
- a fix for invalid platform removal omitting adjacent platforms ([#7170 ](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/7170)).
- fixed universal lockfiles regression  ([#7177](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/7177)).
- dropped Ruby 2.6 and 2.7 support ([#7116](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/7116)).
- fixed bundle install `--system` deprecation advice ([#7190](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/7190)).
- no longer remembering cli flags like` --jobs` or ` --retry` in configuration ([#7191](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/7191)).
- an added option for missing `--prefer-local` to Synopsis in bundle-install.1.ronn ([#7194](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/7194)).
- allowing auto-install to install missing git gems ([#7197](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/7197)).
- ensuring explicit requirement of `rubygems` ([#7139](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/7139)).


In November, RubyGems gained [113 new commits](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/compare/master@%7B2023-11-01%7D...master@%7B2023-11-31%7D) contributed by 23 authors. There were 1,875 additions and 56,824 deletions across 1,496 files.

Some other improvements that landed into our repo this month that are NOT included in the above releases are:
