title: 1.8.0 Released
layout: post
author: fred, the rubygems robot

This release focused on properly encapsulating functionality.  Most of this
work focused on moving functionality out of Gem::SourceIndex and
Gem::GemPathSearcher into Gem::Specification where it belongs.

After installing RubyGems 1.8.0 you will see deprecations when loading your
exsting gems.  Run `gem pristine --all --no-extensions` to regenerate your
gem specifications safely.

Currently RubyGems does not save the build arguments used to build gems with
extensions.  You will need to run `gem pristine gem_with_extension --
--build-arg` to regenerate a gem with an extension where it requires special
build arguments.

* 24(+) Deprecations (WOOT!):

  * DependencyList.from_source_index deprecated the source_index argument.
  * Deprecated Dependency.new(/regex/).
  * Deprecated Gem.searcher.
  * Deprecated Gem.source_index and Gem.available?
  * Deprecated Gem: activate_dep, activate_spec, activate,
    report_activate_error, and required_location.
  * Deprecated Gem::all_partials
  * Deprecated Gem::cache_dir
  * Deprecated Gem::cache_gem
  * Deprecated Gem::default_system_source_cache_dir
  * Deprecated Gem::default_user_source_cache_dir
  * Deprecated Platform#empty?
  * Deprecated Specification.cache_gem
  * Deprecated Specification.installation_path
  * Deprecated Specification.loaded, loaded?, and loaded=
  * Deprecated all of Gem::SourceIndex.
  * Deprecated all of Gem::GemPathSearcher.

* 2 major enhancements:

  * Gem::SourceIndex functionality has been moved to Gem::Specification.
    Gem::SourceIndex is completely disconnected from Gem::Specification

* 41 minor enhancements:

  * Added CommandManager#unregister_command

  * Added Dependency#to_spec
  * Added Gem.pre_reset_hook/s and post_reset_hook/s.
  * Added GemCommand.reset to reinitialize the singleton
  * Added Specification#activate.
  * Added Specification#activated, activated=, and activated?
  * Added Specification#base_dir.
  * Added Specification#bin_dir and bin_file.
  * Added Specification#cache_dir and cache_file. Aliased cache_gem.
  * Added Specification#doc_dir and ri_dir.
  * Added Specification#find(name_or_dep, \*requirements).
  * Added Specification#gem_dir and gems_dir.
  * Added Specification#spec_dir and spec_file.
  * Added Specification.add_spec, add_specs, and remove_spec.
  * Added Specification.all=. If you use this, we will light you on fire.
  * Added Specification.all_names.
  * Added Specification.dirs and dirs=. dirs= resets.
  * Added Specification.find_all_by_name(name, \*reqs)
  * Added Specification.latest_specs. SO TINY!
  * Added TestCase#all_spec_names to help clean up tests
  * Added TestCase#assert_path_exists and refute_path_exists. Will move to
    minitest.
  * Gem.sources no longer tries to load sources gem. Only uses default_sources.
  * Installer no longer accepts a source_index option.
  * More low-level integration.
  * Removed Gem::FileOperations since it is a dummy class
  * Removed a comment because I am dumb
  * Removed pkgs/sources/lib/sources.rb
  * Revamped indexer to mostly not use SourceIndex (legacy index requires it).
  * Rewrote our last functional test suite to be happy and fast
  * RubyGems is now under the Ruby License or the MIT license
  * Specification#== now only checks name, version, and platform.
  * Specification#authors= now forcefully flattens contents (bad rspec! no
    cookie!)
  * Specification#eql? checks all fields.
  * Specification#installation_path no longer raises if it hasn't been
    activated.
  * Specification#validate now ensures that authors is not empty.
  * TestCase.util_setup_spec_fetcher no longer returns a SourceIndex.
  * Uninstaller no longer passes around SourceIndex instances
  * Warn on loading bad spec array values (ntlm-http gem has nil in its cert
    chain)
  * `gem pristine` now accepts --no-executables to skip restoring gems with
    extensions.
  * `gem pristine` can now restore multiple gems.

* 6 bug fixes:

  * DependencyInstaller passed around a source_index instance but used
    Gem.source_index.
  * Fixed Platform#== and #hash so instances may be used as hash keys.
  * Fixed broken Specification#original_platform. It should never be nil.
  * Gem::Text#format_text now strips trailing whitespace
  * Normalize LOAD_PATH with File.expand_path
  * `gem build` errors should exit 1.
  * `gem pristine` can now restore non-latest gems where the cached gem was
    removed.
