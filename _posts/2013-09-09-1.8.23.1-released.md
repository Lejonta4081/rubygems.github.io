_Security fixes:_

* RubyGems 2.0.7 and earlier are vulnerable to excessive CPU usage due to a backtracking in Gem::Version validation.  See [CVE-2013-4287][CVE-2013-4287] for full details including vulnerable APIs.  Fixed versions include 2.0.8, 1.8.26 and 1.8.23.1 (for Ruby 1.9.3).  Issue #626 by Damir Sharipov.
