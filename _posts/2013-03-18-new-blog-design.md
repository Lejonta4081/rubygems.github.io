We have a brand new blog design courtesy of [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com) and [Edwin Morris](http://github.com/ehmorris)!

Some neat facts about this design:

* The code for the blog is all [open source](http://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.github.com) and content is [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/) licensed.
* It's now responsive, so it will look great on any device!
* It's a great example for using [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/), a simple set of SCSS mixins
* All generated with [no Jekyll plugins!](http://quaran.to/blog/2013/01/09/use-jekyll-scss-coffeescript-without-plugins/)

Huge thanks to thoughtbot for a continued commitment to making RubyGems awesome.
