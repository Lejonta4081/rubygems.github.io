Welcome to the RubyGems monthly update! As part of our efforts at [Ruby Together](http://rubytogether.org/), we publish a recap of the work that weâ€™ve done the previous month. Read on to find out what updates were made to RubyGems and RubyGems.org in December.

## RubyGems News

In December, we finally released `bundler 2.2` and `rubygems 3.2` ðŸŽ‰. We also received the corresponding feedback and regression reports, and addressed almost everything reported through 4 patch level releases of each library. In particular, we made it on time for Ruby's Christmas release and managed to include `rubygems 3.2.3` and `bundler 2.2.3` with the final release of `ruby 3.0`.

To be mentioned apart, together with `rubygems 3.2.3` we released a fix to a longstanding gem install issue. From now on, gem install will respect the running ruby version, and install the latest version of the target gem that supports it. See [#4110](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pulls/4110) for more information.

This month, [RubyGems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems) gained [203 new commits](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/compare/master@%7B2020-12-01%7D...master@%7B2020-12-21%7D), contributed by 13 authors. There were 4191 additions and 2066 deletions across 1184 files.

## RubyGems.org News

This month, we published a guide on RubyGems.org about [API keys, their scopes, and CLI usage](https://guides.rubygems.org/api-key-scopes/) - [#275](https://github.com/rubygems/guides/pull/275), we investigated and removed `ruby-bitcoin` and `pretty_color` gems for  containing malicious code which could steal sensitive information, this issue was reported by [@mensfeld](https://github.com/mensfeld) for obfuscated code.Â - [Gems yanked and Accounts Locked Wiki](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/wiki/Gems-yanked-and-accounts-locked#14-dec-2020)

In addition to that, we made the following improvements and fixes:
