# December 2021 Monthly Update

Welcome to the RubyGems monthly update! As part of our efforts at [Ruby Central](http://rubytogether.org/), we publish a recap of the work that we've done the previous month. Read on to find out what updates were made to [RubyGems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems) and [RubyGems.org](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org) in December.

## RubyGems News

In December, we released new versions for RubyGems [3.3.0](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#330--2021-12-21), [3.3.1](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#331--2021-12-22), [3.3.2](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#332--2021-12-23), [3.3.3](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#333--2021-12-24), [3.3.4](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#334--2021-12-29) and Bundler [2.2.33](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/bundler/CHANGELOG.md#2233-december-7-2021), [2.3.0](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/bundler/CHANGELOG.md#230-december-21-2021), [2.3.1](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/bundler/CHANGELOG.md#231-december-22-2021), [2.3.2](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/bundler/CHANGELOG.md#232-december-23-2021), [2.3.3](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/bundler/CHANGELOG.md#233-december-24-2021), [2.3.4](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/bundler/CHANGELOG.md#234-december-29-2021).

With this batch of releases, we finally shipped the Bundler version switching feature, which had been planned for some time now, and provided final versions to be included with new Ruby 3.1 release.
