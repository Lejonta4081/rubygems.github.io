If you are experiencing problems with the source index (e.g. strange
"No Method" errors), or problems with zlib (e.g. "Buffer Error"
messsage), we recommend upgrading to RubyGems 0.9.4.

Bug Fixes Include:

* Several people have been experiencing problems with no method errors
  on the source index cache.  The source index cache is now a bit more
  self healing.  Furthermore, if the source index cache is
  irreparable, then it is automatically dropped and reloaded.
* The source cache files may now be dropped with the "gem sources
  --clear-all" command.  (This command may require root is the system
  source cache is in a root protected area).
* Several sub-commands were accidently dropped from the "gem" command.
  These commands have been restored.
