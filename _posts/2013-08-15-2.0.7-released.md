RubyGems 2.0.7 is a bug-fix release.  To update to the latest RubyGems you can
run:

    gem update --system

If you installed 2.0.1 and are unable to upgrade please follow the [how to
upgrade/downgrade RubyGems][upgrading] instructions.

_Bug fixes:_

* Extensions may now be built in parallel (therefore gems may be installed in parallel).  Bug #607 by Hemant Kumar.
* Changed broken link to RubyGems Bookshelf to point to RubyGems guides.  Ruby pull request #369 by 謝致邦.
* Fixed various test failures due to platform differences or poor tests.  Patches by Yui Naruse and Koichi Sasada.
* Fixed documentation for Kernel#require.
