* Rubygems 0.8.3's installer was broken unless you already had an older
  version of RubyGems installed.  That's fixed.
* Change in the way Gem::Specification internally deals with lazy attributes
  and defaults, bringing (with some loadpath_manager changes) a fairly
  significant increase in speed.
* Support for lower-cased Gem file names (for you, Paul Duncan :)
* Erik Veenstra's patch for making Gem versions sortable.
