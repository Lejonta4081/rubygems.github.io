RubyGems 2.1.10 includes bug fixes.

    gem update --system

RubyGems][upgrading] instructions.  To install RubyGems by hand see the
[Download RubyGems][download] page.

_Bug fixes:_

* Use class check instead of :version method check when creating Gem::Version objects.  Fixes #674 by jkanywhere.
* Fail during `gem update` when an error occurs checking for newer versions. This means RubyGems no longer reports "nothing to update" when it cannot communicate with the server.  Issue #688 by Jimmy Dee.
* Allow installation of gems when the home directory does not exist.  Issue #689 by Laurence Rowe
* Fix updating gems which have multiple platforms.  Issue #693 by Ookami Kenrou.
* The gem server now uses user-provided directories.  Issue #696 by Marcelo Alvim.
* Improved resolution of gems when specific versions have conflicting dependencies.
* RubyGems installs local gems regardless of platform again.  Issue #695
* The `--ignore-dependencies` option for gem installation works again.  Issue #695
