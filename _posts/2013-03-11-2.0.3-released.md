RubyGems 2.0.3 is a bug-fix release.  To update to the latest RubyGems you can
run:

    gem update --system

To install RubyGems by hand see the [Download RubyGems][download] page.

If you installed 2.0.1 and are unable to upgrade please follow the [how to
upgrade/downgrade RubyGems][upgrading] instructions.

_Bug fixes:_

* Reverted automatic upgrade to HTTPS as it breaks RubyGems APIs.  Fixes #506 by Andr√© Arko
* Use File.realpath to remove extra / while checking if files are installable.  Issue #508 by Jacob Evans.
* When installing RubyGems on JRuby, the standard library is no longer deleted.  Fixes #504 by Juan Sanchez, #507 by Charles Oliver Nutter.
* When building extconf.rb extensions use the intermediate destination directory.  This addresses further issues with C extension building.
* Use the absolute path to the generated siteconf in case the extension changes directories to run extconf.rb (like memcached).  Fixes #498 by Chris Morris.
* Fixed default gem key and cert locations.  Pull request #511 by Samuel Cochran.
