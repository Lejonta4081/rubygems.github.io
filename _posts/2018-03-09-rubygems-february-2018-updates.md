Welcome to the RubyGems monthly update! As part of our efforts at [Ruby Together](http://rubytogether.org), we publish a recap of the work that we've done the previous month. Read on to find out what updates were made to RubyGems and RubyGems.org in February.

## RubyGems.org News

In February, we continued to apply security patches and other updates to the servers running RubyGems.org. We also made progress on a new project, collecting metrics from the server logs about what Ruby, RubyGems, and Bundler versions are being actively used. Hopefully we'll have something to show everyone next month!

## RubyGems News

RubyGems saw a lot of activity this month, including the release 2.7.5 and 2.7.6 with _tons_ of bug fixes. The version 2.7.6 release contained some [critical security fixes](https://blog.rubygems.org/2018/02/15/2.7.6-released.html), and is a strongy recommended upgrade. Get out there and run `gem update --system` today!

On top of releasing new code, we also managed to [write out the Ruby version support and release policies](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/2202), and [draft of a minimally disruptive plan for RubyGems 3 and 4](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/2182#issuecomment-364631805).

In total, RubyGems gained 130 new commits, contributed by 12 authors. There were 755 additions and 340 deletions across 50 files.
