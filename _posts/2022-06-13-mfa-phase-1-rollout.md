Attacks on the software supply chain are increasing. Our community has not gone unscathed. RubyGems has been affected by supply chain attacks in the past. Itâ€™s important for us to mitigate these risks as much as possible. Recommending stronger security practices like enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) on high-impact packages will be a first step in improving security of the RubyGems ecosystem.

Account takeovers are the second most common attack on software supply chains ([source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01139)). The countermeasure against this type of attack is simple: enabling MFA. Doing so will help reduce the chances of a successful attack by 99.9 percent ([source](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks/)).

Starting today, top-100 RubyGems package maintainers will begin to see reminders on the RubyGems command-line tool and website if MFA is not enabled on their accounts. Anybody who maintains a gem with more than 165 million downloads will see this recommendation.

Although this is currently just a recommendation, we will enforce MFA on high-impact gems in the future. This policy will bring us in line with other package ecosystems (e.g. [npm](https://github.blog/2022-02-01-top-100-npm-package-maintainers-require-2fa-additional-security/)).

We are committed to fostering a safer, more secure ecosystem for Rubyists. This is one of many steps we plan to take over the coming months in order to maintain a healthy, reliable ecosystem for everyone. Stay tuned!
