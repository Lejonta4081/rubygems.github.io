Attacks on the software supply chain are increasing. Our community has not gone unscathed. RubyGems has been affected by supply chain attacks in the past. Itâ€™s important for us to mitigate these risks as much as possible. Recommending stronger security practices like enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) on popular packages is a first step towards improving security of the RubyGems ecosystem.

Account takeovers are the [second most common](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01139) attack on software supply chains. The countermeasure against this type of attack is simple: enabling MFA. Doing so will help [reduce the chances](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks/) of a successful attack by 99.9 percent.

As proposed in the [MFA rollout RFC](https://github.com/rubygems/rfcs/blob/master/text/0007-mfa-rollout.md), RubyGems is beginning to move towards greater adoption of multi-factor authentication for gem maintainers.

Starting today, the maintainers of the top 100 RubyGems packages will begin to see reminders on the RubyGems command-line tool and website if MFA is not enabled on their accounts. Anybody who maintains a gem with more than 165 million downloads will see this recommendation.

Although this is currently just a recommendation, we will enforce MFA on the top 100 gems in the future. This policy will bring us in line with other package ecosystems (e.g. [npm](https://github.blog/2022-02-01-top-100-npm-package-maintainers-require-2fa-additional-security/)) as well as [GitHub](https://github.blog/2022-05-04-software-security-starts-with-the-developer-securing-developer-accounts-with-2fa/).

We are committed to fostering a safer, more secure ecosystem for Rubyists. This is one of many steps we plan to take over the coming months in order to maintain a healthy, reliable ecosystem for everyone. Stay tuned!
